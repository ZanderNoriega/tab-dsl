# TAB DSL (v0.1.0)

Domain-specific language for creating data representations of guitar tab information.

It should support bass tabs by default.

Drum tab support to come later.

# Contributing

Only accepting bug fixes and tests right now.

When the code is close to my current "vision," I will be open to feature requests.

## Basic development workflow

The typical commands _I_ run during development.

```
$ vim
$ npm run typecheck
$ npm run format
$ npm test
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "feat: Added stuff."
```

(I usually run `typecheck` and `format` as custom commands from vim tho.)

But you do you. (Just don't commit any nonsense generated by your IDE or whatever.)
