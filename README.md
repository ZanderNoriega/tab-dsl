# TAB DSL

Domain-specific language for creating data representations of guitar tab information.

It should support bass tabs by default.

Drum tab support to come later.

# Contributing

Only accepting bug fixes and tests right now.

If you want features... copy the code and implement them yourself!

Meanwhile, I'll focus on implementing what I have in mind.

When the code is close to my current "vision," I will be open to feature requests, if they don't deviate from my goals.
